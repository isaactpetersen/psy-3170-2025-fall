    "text": "9.1 What is Fantasy Football? And Why Focus on Fantasy Football?\nFantasy football is an online game where participants assemble (i.e., “draft”) imaginary teams composed of real-life National Football League (NFL) players. In the game of fantasy football, participants compete against others, accumulating “fantasy” points based on players’ actual statistical performances in games (and the goal is to outscore one’s opponent each week to win matches and ultimately claim victory in the league). Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly. In this way, fantasy football provides a plethora of decision making opportunities in the face of uncertainty, and a wealth of data for analyzing these decisions. However, unlike many other applied domains in psychology, fantasy football (1) allows a person to see the accuracy of their predictions on a timely basis and (2) provides a safe environment for friendly competition. Thus, it provides a unique domain to evaluate—and improve—the accuracy of various prediction models."

There are 29 lectures during the semester (excluding the examinations); in addition, there are two required course surveys (one pre-course survey, one end-of-course survey). You will receive one point for completion of each course survey and attendance at each lecture, for up to 29 points (i.e., you will not receive extra credit for attending/completing all 31 lectures/surveys). Thus, you will not be penalized for missing up to 2 lectures. However, you will be responsible for learning any material missed for quizzes and exams, and I strongly encourage you to attend all lectures. Poor lecture attendance is likely to affect the quality of students’ work and success in the course.\nStudents who miss more than 2 lectures due to participation in University activities must give the instructor a statement before the absence signed by a responsible official that specifies the dates and times the student will miss class. Authorized activities include participation in athletic teams, the marching band or pep band, debate teams, and other recognized University groups, as well as participation in University field trips, service with the National Guard, and jury duty. Absences due to illnesses or emergencies (that go over 2 lectures) must be documented with the University of Iowa Absence Explanation Form and sent to Professor Petersen within 48 hours of the absence. Per university policy, if a student will be absent 5 or more consecutive days and the absence is due to illness or other emergency, please contact the Registrar Service Center at (319) 384-4300 or registrar@uiowa.edu."

    "text": "16.3 Blog Articles (Writing Assignments)\nAs part of the class, you will post blog articles (see the course schedule for deadlines). The blog articles are public; do not take this course if you do not feel comfortable posting blog articles with your full name in a public forum. The blog articles are intended to give you practice integrating skills to advance the learning objectives of a) thinking critically and empirically about human behavior and performance, b) making sense of big data, c) using, evaluating, and interpreting statistical analyses, and d) communicating data-driven insights. There will be a penalty of 20% for all blog articles turned in late. Your two lowest scores will be dropped (excluding the last blog article, which involves in the integration of at least two analysis approaches that were covered in class). A blog article is not considered “submitted” until you (a) post the blog article so that it is live and publicly available, AND (b) submit the assignment on ICON with a PDF of the article and a URL link to your blog article. All blog articles should be submitted to ICON by 11:59 p.m. on the due date. Make sure to follow the rubric for the blog article and to incorporate information on the target topic for that week’s blog article.\nYou are encouraged to submit your blog article well before the deadline. You can expect to run into technical issues (e.g., errors when running your code, issues getting the blog post to compile, etc.). Thus, you should give yourself plenty of time to troubleshoot (see below) so that you can submit your blog article on time.\n\n16.3.1 Troubleshooting\nSometimes code you write does not work. That is okay; it happens to everyone. Learning how to troubleshoot code is an important part of programming. If you run into issues related to R, GitHub, GitHub Pages, or your code, here are a few pointers on how to get things working (as adapted from Luke Tierney):\n\nIf you receive an error message, read what the message says. Sometimes reading the error message is all it takes to figure out what the issue is and how to fix it.\nRead the whole error message: sometimes the most important part is at the beginning.\nIf the message does not make sense to you, perform a Google search for the error/issue: often someone else has asked about the same issue and received a useful answer.\nSimplify your code.\n\nLook carefully at intermediate results.\nReplace complicated data with something smaller and simpler.\nIn the process, you may find your mistake.\n\n\nFinding your bug usually involves double checking all the things you are sure you did right until you find the one you did not.\n\nIf you are unable to resolve things on your own, you may need to ask for help, in which case I encourage you to try one (or more) of the following:\n\nPerform a Google search for the error/issue\nCheck the Troubleshooting section of the course’s Quarto Instructions\nAsk a peer\nPost on forums dedicated to R\n\nAsk AI (as long as you follow the AI policy)\nCome to office hours\n\nI am quite busy, and I appreciate your making every effort to solve the issue on your own or using one of the aforementioned ways before emailing me. I do not often respond to emails during evenings or weekends, and I cannot be expected to solve last-minute issues that you could have solved earlier."

Late responses and multiple submissions will not be accepted. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

Each exam will emphasize information presented for the half of the class that precedes it. However, some integration of information across sections will be required for questions on the second exam. The exams will include multiple-choice questions. Exam questions can come from any of the following sources: lectures or required readings, videos, or learning activities. For suggested study tips for this class, meet with Professor Petersen during office hours.\nPast experience has shown that in order to do well in this class, you should read the required material, participate actively in class, and go over your notes each week. There is too much material being covered in this class to try to study only by frantic preparation immediately before exams. Note that lecture will not cover all relevant material for the course; you will be expected to know the required readings/videos/learning activities for exams.\n\n16.6.1 Missing Exams\nUniversity regulations require that students be allowed to make up examinations that have been missed due to illness, religious holy days, military service obligations (including service-related medical appointments), or other unavoidable circumstances or University-sponsored activities. Students with UI-authorized activities must discuss their absences with the instructor as soon as possible. Religious obligations must be communicated within the first three weeks of classes. See below for the documentation necessary for an absence to be excused and to be eligible to take a make-up exam.\nStudents are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances. Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam. If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, Professor Petersen must be contacted in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam. In order to take a make-up exam, you must provide acceptable documentation to be eligible to take it: including documentation for any report of illness; any other circumstances must be documented by the University of Iowa Absence Explanation Form (located in ICON under “Student Tools”) and must be approved by Professor Petersen. In sum, to be eligible for a make-up exam, Professor Petersen must be contacted before the examination whenever possible, and you must send acceptable form of documentation to Professor Petersen."

That is, you will (likely) be paired with another student in the class to co-manage a team. The league will be hosted on NFL.com and will follow default NFL.com scoring settings. The league will be a head-to-head league, meaning that each week, your team will face one other team, and whichever team scores more points wins that week. There are no course-related points based on your team’s performance (i.e., you will NOT be punished for having a bad team); however, there is an extra credit opportunity for winning the league.\nThe draft will be held during class time. The draft will be a “snake” draft, meaning that the order of picks will reverse each round. The draft order will be randomly determined.\nIn conjunction with your co-manager, you will make decisions regarding your team’s name, draft picks, waiver wire pickups/drops, trades, and starting lineups. Regardless of your expertise or experience with fantasy football, you and your co-manager are each 50% co-owners of the team. That is, you are expected to make all team-related decisions with your co-manager collaboratively, not unilaterally.\nAs the commissioner of the league, I reserve the right to block any trades that that would compromise the integrity of the league. Trades will be allowed as long as each team is acting in their team’s best interests; that is, “lopsided” trades will be allowed as long as both teams are acting in good faith to improve their own team. Trades will not be allowed if they involve collusion, that is, collaboration to cheat or deceive others. Examples of collusion include:\n\ntrading players for the purpose of improving the other team’s standing in the league (and not your own)\ntrading players who are not on bye week, just so an opponent can specifically beat another opponent and then trading those players back immediately\ntrades that involve outside-of-the-game exchange of goods or services\ntrades that involve a handshake agreement of in-game goods or services\ntrades that cannot be completed in one trade"

I reserve the right to determine whether the “fix”, suggestion, or implementation warrants extra credit!\n\n18.1.2 End-of-Semester Video Reflection\nYou can earn 0.5 points extra credit by submitting a short (2–3 minute) video reflecting on your experience in the class. The video should include:\n\nA description of the class, what you learned, and how it will benefit you\nYour favorite part of the class\nWhy (from your perspective) it is valuable to learn statistics\nWhat advice you would give to students who take the class in the future\n\nSubmit the video in the designated assignment on ICON.\n\n18.1.3 Win the Class Fantasy Football League\nThe winner(s) of the class fantasy football league—based on either total points or win/loss record at the end of the class (i.e., Week 14 of the NFL season)—will receive 1 point of extra credit."

In this project, we place special emphasis on the development of neural functioning, as measured by electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), and how neural development influences the development of children’s self-regulation and externalizing problems. EEG is a method of measuring meaningful differences in children’s self-regulation through ERPs—EEG activity that occurs in response to stimuli—which may be a powerful way of reliably detecting patterns of brain activity that predict behavioral outcomes."
